# omnifocus-taskpaper-templates

This project is a collection of [Taskpaper](https://taskpaper.com) templates to be used with [OmniFocus](https://omnigroup.com/omnifocus/). 

Find an explanation of how these are used together in the [OmniFocus Taskpaper Reference by OmniGroup](https://support.omnigroup.com/omnifocus-taskpaper-reference/).

Users are strongly encouraged to load these templates into the [Drafts app](https://getdrafts.com) with Rosemary Orchard's [OF Taskpaper plugin](https://actions.getdrafts.com/g/1F6) by copying and pasting the text.
